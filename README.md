# Global Electronics Sales Dashboard  

## Overview  
This project analyzes sales data for a **global electronics retailer**, providing insights into **revenue trends, customer demographics, product performance, and regional sales distribution**. Using **Excel, Power Query, Pivot Tables, and Charts**, I built an interactive dashboard to help businesses make data-driven decisions.  


## Challenges Faced  

During this project, I encountered several challenges, including:  

- **Data Cleaning Issues** – The raw dataset contained **inconsistent formats, duplicate entries, and missing values**, which required extensive preprocessing.  
- **Merging and Relationship Management** – Sales, customer, and product data were stored separately, requiring **efficient merging using Power Query** instead of manual lookups.  
- **Performance Optimization** – Large datasets slowed down calculations in Pivot Tables, so I optimized performance using **Power Query transformations and efficient data modeling**.  
- **Tracking Yearly Trends** – Sales trends over multiple years needed to be structured properly for **time-based analysis and comparison**.
  

## Tools & Techniques Used  

- **Excel:** Data structuring, calculations, and visualization  
- **Power Query:** Data transformation, cleaning, and merging tables  
- **Pivot Tables & Charts:** Sales performance analysis and trend identification  
- **Data Relationships:** Connected sales, product, and customer tables for dynamic analysis  
- **Lookups (where needed):** Used VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP before transitioning to Power Query
